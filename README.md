# Markdown Book/EBook Template

Template for creating books (paperback and ebook) from Markdown files.

This project contains a template for creating a book (paperback and eBook)
from Markdown sources. It also supports the use of a "book journal",
something I use when I'm plotting out a book. I got this idea from an
article published in
[Writing Mysteries](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Mysteries-Sue-Grafton/dp/1582971021/).
You can see a few examples of a book journal
[here](https://www.suegrafton.com/journal-notes.php)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This project recently underwent major changes. Updates to
the documentation are coming soon. In the meantime, if you want to try using
this, you'll want to look at what the
[_resources/scripts/newbook.py](https://github.com/tammymakesthings/markdown-ebook-template/blob/main/_resources/scripts/newbook.py) script
does and do that manually.
